I can reach out to team members who are not in the meeting by sending them text messages.
You can ask a question and I will tell you their response. 
Just say, hey Xfinity, can you ask Dave such and such? 
I can also quickly loop people into the call.
Just say, hey Xfinity, can you ask Dave to join the call, and I will take care of the rest.`;
